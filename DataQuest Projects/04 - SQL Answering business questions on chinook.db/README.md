The project was part of DataQuest's Data Analyst path and the main objective was to explore a fictional database of music track sales (known as chinook.db) and ask & answer a few common business relevant questions. Personally I enjoy a lot writting SQL queries, by doing the project I realized I still have a lot to learn when it comes to making the queries more simple and less demanding of processing.
