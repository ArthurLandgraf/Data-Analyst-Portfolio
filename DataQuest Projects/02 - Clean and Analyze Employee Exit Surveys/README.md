The project was part of DataQuest's Data Analyst path and the main objective was to clean and merge two different datasets with Employee Exit Surveys, and extract insights with regards to **Dissatisfied Resignations** also trying to understand some patterns behind it. Personally I learned a lot with this project by dealing with common challenges with cleaning data, and also finding the final insights was also quite a journey.

Here's a peek of the final outcome:
