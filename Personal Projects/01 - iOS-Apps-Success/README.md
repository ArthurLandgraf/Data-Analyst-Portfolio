The project aims to provide iOS developers some insights regarding a few basic elements that constitute specifically free apps. To produce such insights, I'll analyze a sample out of the more than 2 million apps in App Store, and with some essential elements common in all apps (ratings, app name...) create a scoring system and rank the apps, later splitting the sample into Successful apps versus Failed apps and generating comparisions.

My first contact with this topic was through DataQuest, this dataset was used for their first project on the Data Analyst Path. However here I had a different approach to the same dataset, this time with no guidelines and just me building a project from scratch trying to practice and showcase my knowledge in Python and it's wonderful modules & libraries.

#### OBJECTIVE
---
Generate a graphical representation of the correlation between specific elements and the success/failure of an app. The **elements to be analyzed** are:
- App's genre in comparision to other genres
- App's name length & words count
- App's size in bytes

#### PERSONAL LEARNINGS
---
This was my first project and managing my time was the first and most important learning. By managing time I mean: Prioritizing tasks, giving up on some interesting things to do but that won't help me with the project goal, and also keeping the time invested productive.

Other than that, it was great to take some non-guided practice in a project of my ownership from the goal setting till the execution and delivery. I can't even list down all technical learnings because I did so many researches online through documentation and forums...
